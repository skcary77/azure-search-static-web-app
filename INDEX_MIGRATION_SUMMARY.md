## New Index Field Mapping

| New Field | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `page_id` | String | Primary key |
| `journal` | String | Publication name |
| `published_at` | DateTime | Publication date |
| `author` | String | Article author |
| `persons` | String | Person mentions |
| `companies` | String | Company mentions |
| `industries` | String | Industry categorization |
| `tags` | String | Content tags |
| `categories` | String | Content categories |
| `primary_channels` | String | Primary channel classification |
| `secondary_channels` | String | Secondary channel classification |
| `page_content` | String | Full article content (includes title and text) |
| `people` | Array | Array of people mentioned |
| `organizations` | Array | Array of organizations mentioned |

## Facet Configuration
Updated to support the following facets:
- `author` (string)
- `journal` (string)
- `industries` (string)
- `tags` (string)
- `primary_channels` (string)
- `secondary_channels` (string)
- `organizations` (array)
- `people` (array)

## Content Parsing
The `page_content` field contains structured content in the format:
```
Title: [Article Title]

 Text: [Article Content]
```

The application now parses this structure to extract and display the title and content separately.

## Next Steps
1. Update environment variables in your deployment to use the new index name and facets
2. Ensure the "page-content-index" exists in your Azure Search service
3. Test the search functionality with the new data structure
4. Consider updating the UI styling to better accommodate news article content vs. book data

## Testing
After deployment, verify:
- Search results display correctly with article titles and metadata
- Faceted search works with the new fields
- Individual article details page shows all relevant information
- Lookup functionality works with page_id values
- Suggestion functionality works with the new index
